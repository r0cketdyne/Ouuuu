Part IIa: Writing your own functions
We will complete this program that requires the definition of a function named computeGCRatio to
compute the GC content of a DNA molecule.
Given a single string as input where each character is one of G, C, T or A, the GC ratio is computed as the
count of G+C values over the total count of A,T,C,G values. It is often written in texts as the following,
where each letter represents the count of instances in the string
"""
# Lab 8
# PUT YOUR DEFINITION OF THE FUNCTION computeGCRatio HERE!
# Hint: your function will need 4 counter variables ( one for each
# letter. And you will need to write a loop that steps through each
# character in the string
def computeGCRatio( # what is/are the parameters needed here?
 # complete the logic here):




#FUGAZZI
#import math
#x = 3.1;
#y = 1.0 - x;

#print("This evalues to ", math.fabs(y))
#1 evaluated to 2.1 returns the absolute val of a num, as a float

#print("This evalues to ", math.floor(x))
#2 evaluates to 3. this particular method rounds a number DOWN to the nearest integer.
#print("This evalues to ", math.ceil(x))
#this evaluates to 4. rounds up to nearest int
#print("This evaluates to", math.floor(y))
#this evaluates to -3 this, obviously then must round down to nearest int
#print("This evalues to", math.ceil(y))
#this evaluates to -2, and again, here it must again round up

#biggest thing here. help(math) is a GREAT in console problem solving toolkit.
